We randomly generated a year from each decade starting with the 1980’s all the way up till the 2020’s.  We used the package baseballr, which uses data various sources like FanGraphs, Baseball-Reference, and Baseball Savant.  And with the data, we put it into R and created scatter plots to visualize our results.
